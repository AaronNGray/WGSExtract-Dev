#Betav2b MacOSX Patch File Instructions

This is describing how to overlay the [MacOSX patch file]() for the current [Betav2b release from 18 February 2020]().

1. Click [here to download the MacOSX patch file](). Your MacOSX will ask if it is OK to download from the github.com site.  Say OK.
1. Go to your Downloads directory and see the already unzipped archive folder there with 4 items inside.
2. Drag those four items to your WGSExtract top-level install directory.  There should already be 3 xxx_Start.sh fles there.

Simply double click on Install_MacOSX.app to run the installer (this was formerly most of the MacOSX_Start.sh)

Simply double click on Start_MacOSX.app to run the WGS Extract program.

You can create an alias of the Start_MacOSX.app file (right click, Make ALias), rename it (Say WGSExtract), and move it to wherever
you want to have an icon to simply double click and start the program.  Often the Applications folder in Finder or maybe the desktop).

Since the initial MacOS release back in December, 2019, the MacOS_start.sh script has been horribly broken. 
While we documented it and the fixes in the Users Manual, it has been a silent show stopper for
many.  While we fixed it back just after the v2B release in February, no one complained so we never went
forward with this patch.  We just assumed there were no MacOSX users. Guess it was more ones who simply
tried and gave up without a word.
