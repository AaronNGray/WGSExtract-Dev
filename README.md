# WGS Extract Development

This is the main **WGS Extract** Development repository and support area for coders and others with a deeper understanding of the tool.  

See [WGS Extract Users](https://wgsextract.github.io/) for the main entry point for users. This is where to download a release and find documentation related to using the tool. 

Most user support occurs in the [Dante Labs and Nebula Genomics Customers](https://www.facebook.com/groups/373644229897409/ "30x WGS Facebook") Facebook group where support for these Direct-to-Consumer (DTC), sub-$500, 30x Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) tests has been most discussed.

See also [WGS Extract Historical](https://github.com/WGSExtract/WGSExtract-Historical "WGSE Historical") for a likely archive of the original work and tool in 2019 by Marko B before others started to get involved to help build on his initial body of work.
